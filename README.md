Welcome to the Rocket Project repository! This project aims to create a rocket system that can be ignited remotely using a web interface. The project involves building a rocket with an A6-3 engine and integrating it with a web-based control system.

Features
Remote Ignition: Ignite the rocket from a web interface.
Delay Mechanism: Includes a 10-second delay before ignition.
Solid Fuel Engine: Utilizes an A6-3 engine for propulsion.
Components
Rocket: Equipped with an A6-3 solid fuel engine.
Ignitor: Connects to the rocket engine to initiate combustion.
ESP32: Microcontroller used for controlling the ignition process.
Web Interface: Allows users to ignite the rocket remotely via a button.
Setup
Hardware Requirements
A6-3 rocket engine
Rocket body and ignitor
ESP32 microcontroller
Power supply for ESP32
Connecting wires and components
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
Web server software (e.g., Flask, Node.js) for handling the web interface
Wokwi for simulation and testing
Installation
Assemble the Rocket:

Attach the A6-3 engine to the rocket body.
Connect the ignitor to the engine.
Setup the ESP32:

Connect the ESP32 to your computer.
Open the Arduino IDE and install necessary libraries for the ESP32.
Upload the provided code to the ESP32.
Configure the Web Interface:

Set up a web server to handle the remote ignition.
Implement the web interface with a button to trigger the ignition.
Ensure the server communicates with the ESP32 to control the ignitor.
Testing:

Test the system in a safe environment.
Verify that the 10-second delay works and the ignitor fires correctly.
Usage
Connect to the Web Interface:

Open the web interface on your device.
Ignite the Rocket:

Press the ignition button.
Wait for the 10-second delay and observe the rocket ignition.
Safety
Always perform tests in a controlled and safe environment.
Follow all safety guidelines for handling and igniting rocket engines.
Ensure proper supervision during testing.
